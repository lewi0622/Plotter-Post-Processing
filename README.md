# Plotter-Post-Processing
My personal approach to post processing my svg plotter files. This is not meant to be a complete GUI-fication of Vpype.

## Issues
If you have an issue or feature request, feel free to submit it. I will choose to fulfill feature requests if they are useful to me. Pull requests are always welcome.

## Dependencies
All of these utilities require [Vpype](https://github.com/abey79/vpype), and some of it's plug-ins, to be installed. I do not provide an installer.
Last tested using 
- Python Version 3.10.4
- Vpype Version 1.14.0
- Occult Version 0.1
